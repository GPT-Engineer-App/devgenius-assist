## I want to use a custom domain - is that possible?

We don't support custom domains (yet). If you want to deploy your project under your own domain, then we recommend GitHub Pages.

To use GitHub Pages you will need to follow these steps: 
- Deploy your project using GitHub Pages - instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site#creating-your-site)
- Configure a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site - instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site)
